        <p>The journey to the Cloud is unique for every company. We’ve taken best practices from leading public cloud providers and built our Cloud Execution Framework – an iterative process to guide you on your specific journey using a proven pattern to success.</p>
        	<p>
        	Mapping the Journey is the first and most important part in the Cloud Execution Framework process. It starts with answering a few key questions.</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>
        		Where are you today?</li>
        	<li>
        		Where do you want to go?</li>
        	<li>
        		What are your business priorities?</li>
        	<li>
        		What are the projects you want to move into the Cloud?</li>
        	<li>
        		When do you want these projects to be in the Cloud?</li>
        	<li>
        		Are there any restrictions (e.g. technology choices, customer commitments, regulatory, etc)?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The journey to the Cloud does not look the same for every business. This initial exercise is to help you map the journey to your timeline and your priorities. Your business may have processes in place that make parts of the journey very simple, but you may also have gaps that will require more focus. The end result is an agreed-upon Roadmap of iterative processes.<br />
        	</p>
        	<strong>One Cloud Execution Framework, Six Unique ViewPoints</strong><br />
        	Moving to the Cloud can be complex. The Cloud Execution Framework adds structure to the complexity by breaking it down into six easy-to-understand ViewPoints. ViewPoints are based on various stakeholders’ perspectives and address the objectives and concerns that come from relevant partners and team members.</p>

                <p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">The Cloud has brought a lot of change to modern IT. &nbsp;No longer limited by the capital outlay for hardware, data centers, and the need to manually manage infrastructure, the Cloud has brought an elasticity and automation to the IT world that we have never seen before. &nbsp;Old ways of architecting and developing applications no longer apply in this new dynamic.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Kinect Consulting offers application architecture consulting and development for medium to large companies that are looking for specific experience in moving an enterprise to the Cloud.</span></span></p>

                <p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Kinect Consulting was formed by spinning off the IT Architecture and Strategy leadership from a Fortune 100 company, World Fuel Services. &nbsp;Word Fuel Service, had embarked on a leading-edge journey to developing software specifically to take advantage of both Native and Hybrid Cloud services. This was not a journey of "lift and shift" to the Cloud, this was a journey of taking full advantage of all the Public Cloud has to offer as a platform. World Fuel Services is Kinect Consulting's largest client.</span></span></p>
